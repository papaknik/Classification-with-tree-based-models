# ML Classification with tree-based models

## Project Overview

In this small practice project, we perform data analysis on the `PimaIndiansDiabetes2` dataset, which is available with the R package **mlbench**. 
This dataset includes:
- **768** female Indian patients above 21 years old.
- **Eight** individual characteristics (predictor variables).
- A target/response variable indicating whether each patient is diagnosed with diabetes (positive or negative).

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting an individual's likelihood of diabetes based on the specified characteristics. Our ultimate goal is to identify factors contributing to a positive diagnosis of diabetes. This knowledge can aid in the development of precautionary measures to prevent or postpone this chronic metabolic disorder.

## Challenges

"One of the main challenges encountered in this practice is the high ratio of missing values, which, during the project, was found to occur not at random."

## Methodology

All models used for classification are tree-based. The project concludes with a brief comparison of the performance of each applied algorithm.
